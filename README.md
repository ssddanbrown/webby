# Webby

A tiny static webserver app written in go.

Just to be clear - I currently have very little experience in writing Go so please allow a little slack in the code quality.
If you spot areas to be improved please create a pull request.

The app also acts as a live-reload server. [Browser extensions found here.](http://livereload.com/extensions/)
